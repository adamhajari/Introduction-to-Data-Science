    "The simplest way to store data is with a text file. Reading and writing to a text file from Python is simple [link], and those files can easily be opened with any text editor. A text file can take any form, but your file needs to be parsable. That means when fetching data from the file you (or more commonly, a computer program) needs to know where one data point ends and the next begins.  The standard convention for storing data is by comma sparated value (or CSVs). CSVs store data the same way an excel spreadsheet does, with rows and columns. Let's say you had three rows and three columns of integer values to store. You would store that data in a CSV as:\n",
    "````\n",
    "1,2,2\n",
    "3,2,1\n",
    "4,4,3\n",
    "````\n",
    "Rows are separated by a new line, and columns by commas. Knowing this simple convention makes it easy for a computer to parse the file so that it can then do something with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases CSVs are actually a bad choice for storing data. Suppose that one of the fields contains names of bands:\n",
    "````\n",
    "ACDC,2,1\n",
    "Lady Gaga,4,3\n",
    "Peter,Paul and Marry,1,3\n",
    "````\n",
    "Are \"Peter\" and \"Paul and Marry\" two different columns? It's obvious to most people that they're not, but not at all obvious to a computer. If you're storing strings and there's chance that you may have commas in those strings, CSVs aren't going to work. Luckily, there are plenty of other more obscure characters that can be used to separatate values. If commas aren't a good choice, then you may choose to go with tabs (represented by \\t):\n",
    "````\n",
    "ACDC\\t2\\t1\n",
    "Lady Gaga\\t4\\t3\n",
    "Peter, Paul and Marry\\t1\\t3\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "You could easily write your own CSV Python parser, but a number of Python tools already exist to do this for you. Let's look at how you'd do this with pandas."
